                        <p>A smart hydroponic monitoring system that allows the user to have a close control of the of health and conditions of a hydroponic system. Checking data from PH in the water solution, water and environment temperature, humidity,
                            PPM, and solar radiance. The monitored data is then presented in a graphical user interface to allow the user to interact and evaluate what actions to take to maximize crop yield and plant health.</p>

                        <h4>Hydroponic System</h4>
                        <p>Developed a hydroponic system in an urban area in Tijuana using only a wall with a restricted dimension of 2.5 meters by 4 meters. This design was created with budget and local supplies in mind, making it easier to be replicated
                            in other urban areas. The system is composed of 6 PVC tubes that allow for nutrient rich water to travel across the roots of lettuce plants, keeping a constant flow while cycling the water in a reservoir that collects and reuses
                            the water, a small pump keeps a constant flow in the system.</p>

                        <h4>Monitoring system</h4>
                        <p>The monitoring system microcontroller is the ESP 32 that allows for easy connectivity to WIFI, making it possible to upload data to a server. The sensors used are a PH sensor, a PPM sensor, a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor,
                            a UV light sensor and a lux sensor. For the analog sensors that require precision an external 16-bit ADC was used connected via I2C. The circuit was creating using a perforated board and a 3D printed board to bolt and hold
                            all the components together. All this was then placed inside a weatherproof cabinet to prevent water and humidity to enter. A weatherproof casing was 3D printed and painted to allow constant humidity and temperature readings
                            of the environment without getting wet. The lux and UV sensors are protected using clear epoxy.<br></p>

                    <div class="col">
                        <h4>Local and cloud integration</h4>
                        <p>The data is sent to a cloud and local solution, allowing for both remote and local monitoring. In the local solution a raspberry pi is used as a server running home assistance, which is an integrator for smart houses that has services
                            like a database and a web graphical user interface. The cloud solution is used running Microsoft azure services where an MQTT broker and a database system stores the data. The ESP32 sends data to the respective MQTT broker
                            for a light bandwidth data transfer, which is then stored in both databases.<br><br>The cloud integration is designed to be expandible to multiple hydroponic monitoring systems allowing for a scalable solution.<br><br></p>
